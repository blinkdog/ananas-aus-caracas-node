Ondřej Žára's rot.js tutorial game Ananas aus Caracas ported to Node.js

## rot.js Tutorial
Ondřej Žára wrote a great Roguelike Toolkit library in JavaScript called
[rot.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/). This library was recently
ported to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). A user on GitHub asked that
the tutorial game be ported to Node.js, as a working example. This
repository is that port.
